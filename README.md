> [!CAUTION]
> This is an ***unofficial*** port of Superfighters Redux to Superfighters Deluxe `v.1.4.1b`.
> 
> The Superfighters Redux build used is the latest of SFR's repository, `v.1.0.5_dev`, and it is still in development. Due to both this, and the porting process you may experience crashes or unintended game behavior.
>
> Do ***not*** let this be your first experience of Superfighters Redux, I highly recommend playing the original build for SFD `v.1.3.7d`. You can get SFD `v.1.3.7d` through Steam betas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod is still a work-in-progress. Features may break, be added, removed, or changed entirely.
